### Session Summary: 2025-09-02

**Goal:** Implement the "Analyze with AI" feature for job opportunities using the Google Gemini API.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1.  **Backend Foundation:**
    *   Added the `google-generativeai` dependency to `requirements.txt` and resolved installation issues.
    *   Created `backend/prompts.py` to house a detailed prompt template for the AI analysis.
    *   Created `backend/gemini_api.py` to encapsulate all logic for interacting with the Gemini API.
    *   Added a new `POST /jobs/analyze` endpoint to `backend/main.py` to orchestrate the analysis.

2.  **Frontend Integration:**
    *   Added an `analyzeJob` function to the frontend's API library (`src/lib/api.ts`).
    *   Replaced the mock-data `AIAnalysis.tsx` component with a fully functional version that calls the backend and displays loading, error, and success states.

**Unresolved Issue & Debugging Journey:**

The primary challenge of the session was a persistent error when calling the Gemini API from the backend.

*   We encountered and fixed several consecutive errors:
    1.  An `IndentationError` in `main.py`.
    2.  A `ValueError` from a mismatched API key name in the `.env` file.
    3.  A `KeyError` from incorrect string formatting in the prompt.
    4.  An `asyncio.CancelledError` suggesting a request timeout, which we addressed by adding an explicit timeout.
*   To isolate the problem, we created a `test.py` script, which confirmed the issue was within the `gemini_api.py` module itself.
*   The final error we faced was an `AttributeError`, indicating an incorrect usage of the Google AI library, even after attempting to align the code with user-provided examples.

**Next Steps:**

*   The immediate priority for the next session is to resolve the `AttributeError` in the `test.py` script to achieve a successful, isolated API call to the Gemini service.
