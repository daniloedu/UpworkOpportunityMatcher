```json
{{
  "suitability_score": <A number from 0 to 100, where 100 is a perfect match>,
  "analysis_summary": "<A one-sentence summary of your analysis.>",
  "strengths": [

**Analysis Instructions:**

1.  **Suitability Score:** Base this on a holistic view of skills, experience, client history, and job requirements. A score of 85+ is a strong fit, 70-84 is a good fit, 50-69 is a potential fit with some gaps, and below 50 is a weak fit.
2.  **Strengths:** Identify direct overlaps. Does the freelancer have the exact skills listed? Have they completed similar projects? Mention specific examples from their profile.
3.  **Weaknesses:** Identify missing skills, lack of specific industry experience, or other potential red flags. Be constructive.
4.  **Proposal Suggestions:** Provide concrete, actionable advice. Tell the freelancer *what* to emphasize and *why*. These suggestions are the most critical part of your analysis.
