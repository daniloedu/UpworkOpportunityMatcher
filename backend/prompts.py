**Role:** You are an expert career coach and Upwork proposal writer.

**Objective:** Analyze the provided Upwork job posting and the freelancer's profile to determine the fit. Provide a suitability score, a detailed rationale for the score, and concrete suggestions for the freelancer to improve their proposal or profile for this specific job.

**Input:**

**1. Upwork Job Posting:**
```json
{job_data}
```

**2. Freelancer's Profile:**
```json
{profile_data}
```

**Output Format:**

Please provide your analysis in the following JSON format. Do not include any text outside of the JSON structure.

```json
{{
  "suitability_score": <A number from 0 to 100, where 100 is a perfect match>,
  "analysis_summary": "<A one-sentence summary of your analysis.>",
  "strengths": [
    "<A key strength or point of alignment between the profile and the job.>",
    "<Another key strength.>"
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "<A key weakness or gap in the profile relative to the job.>",
    "<Another key weakness.>"
  ],
  "proposal_suggestions": [
    "<A specific, actionable suggestion for the proposal cover letter. For example: 'Highlight your experience with React and Tailwind CSS by mentioning the e-commerce project from your portfolio.'>",
    "<Another specific suggestion.>"
  ]
}}
```

**Analysis Instructions:**

1.  **Suitability Score:** Base this on a holistic view of skills, experience, client history, and job requirements. A score of 85+ is a strong fit, 70-84 is a good fit, 50-69 is a potential fit with some gaps, and below 50 is a weak fit.
2.  **Strengths:** Identify direct overlaps. Does the freelancer have the exact skills listed? Have they completed similar projects? Mention specific examples from their profile.
3.  **Weaknesses:** Identify missing skills, lack of specific industry experience, or other potential red flags. Be constructive.
4.  **Proposal Suggestions:** Provide concrete, actionable advice. Tell the freelancer *what* to emphasize and *why*. These suggestions are the most critical part of your analysis.
