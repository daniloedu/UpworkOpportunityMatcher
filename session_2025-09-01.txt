Session Summary: 2025-09-01

Today was a highly productive session where we achieved significant progress on the Upwork Opportunity Matcher application.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1.  **Upwork GraphQL API Integration:**
    *   Successfully debugged and formulated complex GraphQL queries to extract comprehensive freelancer profile data (personal details, employment history, skills, certificates, education) from the Upwork API.
    *   Overcame various API schema challenges and error messages through iterative refinement.

2.  **Backend Profile Endpoint Implementation:**
    *   Created a new backend endpoint (`GET /profile`) in `backend/main.py` to serve the fetched Upwork profile data to the frontend.
    *   Implemented the data fetching logic in `backend/upwork_api.py`.

3.  **Frontend Profile Display:**
    *   Integrated the Upwork profile data into the `UserProfile.tsx` component, replacing hardcoded information with live data.

4.  **Bug Fixing & Refinements:**
    *   Resolved critical authentication redirect issues between the backend and frontend.
    *   Fixed frontend API client configuration (`baseURL`) and module import/export errors (`UserProfile` component).
    *   Addressed a Python `SyntaxError` in the backend due to incorrect indentation.

5.  **New Feature: Local Editable Profile Data (Encrypted):**
    *   **Backend:**
        *   Added `cryptography` dependency and implemented secure encryption/decryption for local data.
        *   Created `backend/encryption.py` and `backend/local_profile_storage.py` for handling encrypted file storage.
        *   Implemented new backend endpoints (`GET /local-profile` and `POST /local-profile`) to manage this data.
    *   **Frontend:**
        *   Enhanced `UserProfile.tsx` to fetch and display both Upwork and local profile data.
        *   Implemented an "Edit" mode allowing users to update `location`, `additional_details`, `local_skills`, `local_certificates`, and `local_education` (stored as text areas).
        *   Ensured Upwork data remains read-only while local data is editable and persistent.

This session significantly advanced the application's core functionality and user experience.
